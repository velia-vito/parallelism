  <p>Run Code in parallel without having to worry about low-level <a href="https://api.dart.dev/stable/3.8.1/dart-isolate/Isolate-class.html">Isolate</a> details.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<h3 id="multi-threading-vs-multi-processing">Multi-threading vs. Multi-processing</h3>
<p>Imagine your code as one long string, this string has knots on it that you have to untangle,
you have to paint the untangled sections red. The string is your logic-flow, and the knots are
things you have to wait for (e.g a network request or reading a file from your OS or waiting for
a specified amount of time,) and the painting the untangled string is further processing after
the waiting for data.</p>
<p>In single-threaded processing, you move down the thread till the first knot, stop till your
friend untangles it, you paint it, then you move till the next knot, wait for your friend to
untangle it, then you paint it and so on. You spend a significant amount of time waiting.</p>
<p>In multi-threading, you move down to the first knot, hand it off to your friend and instead of
waiting, you move on down to the next knot, pass it to your friend (irrespective of weather he
has untangled the first one or not) and continue moving down the string and handing off new
knots. When  your friend untangles the first knot,  you pause your hunt for the next knot, and
go paint the freshly returned untangled section while he untangles the next knot you sent him.
You go back to finding the next knot till he's done with the second knot. Here a good chunk of
the waiting time from your earlier single-threaded system is actually utilized doing searching
for the next knot instead of simply idling. More work is getting done in lesser time. The more
waiting time your single-threaded process takes, the more time multi-threading will save.</p>
<p>In parallel process, it's not just you working on a single string while waiting for your friend
to untangle knots. You either have 16 people and their friends working on 16 different strings
or you have 16 people and their friends working on 16 different sections of the same string
<em><em>all at same time</em></em> i.e you're doing 16x the work in the same time, or the same work in 1/16th
of the time. THe key part is that there are 16 people and their friends here.</p>
<p>If multi-threading is about reducing wait times. Multi-processing is about increasing the number
of workers. It's not optimizing, it's brute-forcing.</p>
<h3 id="isolates-101">Isolates 101</h3>
<p>Most low level languages and quiet a few high level languages have multi-processing
capabilities, but how it works in Dart and other languages have one major difference.</p>
<p>In other languages, each separate process (each worker) has a shared context i.e resources are
shared like different artisans in a workshop with only one CNC Machine or 3D Printer. If an
artisan need to use the 3D printer but but someone else has already started printing a part. He
will either have to wait, cancel the other printing task, or his attempts to print his part
before the other person's printing task is done and will mess up both peoples work. To prevent
the last situation (which usually means memory overruns, corrupted data, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition">data race
conditions</a>,) you need to implement a <em>global
lock</em> that ensure that only one process can access those shared resources at any given time.
This is both finicky and and a pain in the ass.</p>
<p>In dart, there are no shared resources. If you create an object that takes up a lot of memory
and you need all your processes to have access to it, you either create a dozen copies of it an
fill up the OS memory, or you create some other alternative way to access just the relevant
parts of the data without loading the whole thing into memory. Same goes for computationally
heavy to create objects, like say, a hash map.</p>
<p>But, on the flip side, you don't have to worry about a <em>global lock</em>, race conditions that
permanently brick your program, or unexplained crashes. This also means that individual
processes do not have to wait on resources. It's a much more robust and efficient system if more
resource heavy. So, keep that in mind when you write code for prallelization.</p>
<h3 id="futures-are-not-deferred-data">Futures are not deferred data</h3>
<p>When you get  get a <a href="https://api.dart.dev/stable/3.8.1/dart-core/Future-class.html">Future</a> object, you're not getting a container that will be filled with
data later. You're getting a <em>promise</em> that the data will be available at some point in the
future. A future "completes" when the promise is upheld and the data is either sent for further
processing (when you use <a href="https://api.dart.dev/stable/3.8.1/dart-core/Future/then.html">Future.then</a>) or when you <code>await</code>.</p>
<p>This means that you really need to know what promise any returned future represents. For
example, if you write a <code>Future&lt;void&gt; sendTenRequests()</code> function that sends 10 network requests
(with no custom <a href="https://api.dart.dev/stable/3.8.1/dart-async/Completer-class.html">Completer</a>), the default returned future from the function will complete when
the 10 requests are sent, and because the requests are part of the local scope, you now have not
way to wait till the sever responds to the requests outside of the function. The person calling
this function may not be aware of the difference and assume that awaiting <code>sendTenRequests</code> will
ensure that the server has responded to all 10 requests, which is not the case.</p>
<h3 id="microtasks-vs-events">Microtasks vs. Events</h3>
<p>Your program is split into <em>Events</em> (or tasks, which ever you want to call them) — chunks of
code to be executed on particular triggers. Even a "purely sequential" program can be split up
into tasks that require waiting in between. Consider the simple task of writing data to console,
 this requires waiting for your OS to provide you  access to the output sink, and hence the
logic before would be split into one event and the logic after into a separate event triggered
by obtaining access to the standard output sink.</p>
<p>The very first task on the "Event Queue" is to start the execution of the <code>main</code> function. This
event queue is sequential, but some tasks are extremely important and have to be handled on a
high priority basis. Dart uses a separate first-in-first-out event queue called the "Microtask
Queue".</p>
<p>Events on the microtask queue are given greater priority than events in the event queue i.e the
event queue processing is always put on hold until the microtask queue is empty.</p>
<p>When you run an async function with <a href="https://api.dart.dev/stable/3.8.1/dart-core/Future/then.html">Future.then</a> to handle the returned value, the callback in
internally registered within the Future, and whenever the future completes, the callback is
added to the microtask queue. What this means is that there is a gap between triggering the
future and the callback being added to the microtask queue. A gap during which the program may
exit. On using <code>await</code>, much the same happens, but the rest of the logic after the <code>await</code> is
registered as the callback and added to the microtask queue.</p>
<p>Why is this important? One, avoid using <code>await</code> as much as possible. The point of
multi-threading is to reduce waiting time, and <code>await</code> adding all the subsequent logic to the
microtask queue means that the program will simply stop and wait for a response before doing the
rest of the logic. It will still save you time if you're doing separate tasks (e.g downloading a
file and writing a completely different file to disk,) but otherwise it might as well be purely
sequential. Using <code>Future.then</code> is better as it only adds the callback to the microtask queue
and continues program execution. While there is much to gain from using <code>then</code> it requires you
to be aware of what exactly is being tracked by the returned future i.e as long as you ensure
that the future <em>completes</em>, you can be assured that the post-processing will be done.</p>
<p>Example pf the differences in <code>await</code> vs. <code>then</code> can be seen at
<a href="https://github.com/velia-vito/utils/blob/main/bin/avtfuture.dart">avtfuture.dart</a>) with some
minimal explanation.</p>
<h2 id="design-overview">Design Overview</h2>
<p>Isolates are basically separate programs that run in parallel to the main program due to the
lack of a shared context. This, coupled with the process for creation of a new isolate means
that you can essentially think of it as one big function that run on a different processor.</p>
<p>This means that something like creating a persistent HTTP client for downloading multiple files
whose links will be provided at different points in time is not possible. You'd simply create
a new HTTP client for each "call" to the isolate, which is inefficient.</p>
<p>This is handled internally by the library. A custom loop is created for the main function:
<code>setupProcess</code> -&gt; <code>processInput</code> (repeatedly) -&gt; <code>shutdownProcess</code>. The logic is in the users
control, and they are the ones who code all three callbacks, but the actual code run in the
isolate is pre-defined in the library.</p>
<h3 id="processsetupprocess--cr"><a href="../parallelize/Process/setupProcess.html">Process.setupProcess</a> &amp; <code>CR</code></h3>
<p>Used to create any persistent objects/resources that will be reused across all processing done
within the isolate. Since Dart doesn't support arbitrary length arguments, all generated
resources need to be bundled into a single <a href="https://dart.dev/language/records">Record</a>. This
record is generically typed as <code>CR</code> for <em>Common Resources</em>.</p>
<pre class="language-dart"><code class="language-dart">// Creating a "record" with field names.
var commonResources = (id: 10, name: 'Example', client: httpClient);
</code></pre>
<h3 id="processprocessinput"><a href="../parallelize/Process/processInput.html">Process.processInput</a></h3>
<p>Take an input &amp; the common resources, process the input and return a result. The library
automatically handles the passing of the output back to the main isolate. This usually requires
unpacking of the <code>CR</code> record.</p>
<pre class="language-dart"><code class="language-dart">// Full unpacking of a record.
var (id, name, client) = commonResources;

// field access of a record.
var client = commonResources.client;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="processshutdownprocess"><a href="../parallelize/Process/shutdownProcess.html">Process.shutdownProcess</a></h3>
<p>Takes the Common Resources and cleans them up if necessary.</p>
<h3 id="processprocessingiscomplete"><a href="../parallelize/Process/processingIsComplete.html">Process.processingIsComplete</a></h3>
<p>Both are internal <a href="https://api.dart.dev/stable/3.8.1/dart-async/Completer-class.html">Completer</a> that only completes when all the sent inputs have been processed.
This is done by assigning a <code>inputID</code> to each input, and then logging the input under
"unprocessed inputs". When the isolate finishes processing the input, it send back the output
with the related <code>inputID</code>. We need to do this as there is no shared context for the isolate to
update the main isolate about the progress of anything.</p>
<p>When a call is made to <a href="../parallelize/Process/shutdownOnCompletion.html">Process.shutdownOnCompletion</a>, the isolate is marked as "close for new
inputs" (or inactive)., the <code>processingIsComplete</code> future completes only when all inputs in the
"unprocessed inputs" list have been processed and the isolate is closed for further inputs. It
essentially tracks overall completion of all futures, so that the user does't have to.</p>

<li>The words <code>Process</code> and <code>Isolate</code> are used interchangeably in this library.</li>
